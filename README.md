# boredTasks

## Project Description

### Welcome to Not Bored Tasks! In this interactive application you will be able to look for interesting tasks for yourself and perform them!

## Project Objectives

1. API integration: We will use the Bored API to load data dynamically. The received data will be used to create cards.

2. Creation of cards: Based on the response from the `Bored API`, we will create cards that will contain interesting ideas. The cards will be displayed in the "Choose fresh ideas to do" section of the `HOME` page.

3. Slider implementation: In the "Ideas in my list" section of the `LIST` page, we will add a slider that allows you to move between list items. You'll be able to scroll through the ideas saved in your list. You can also view these cards as a regular list by clicking on the `OPEN LIST` button.

4. Adding a card to the slider: When you click on a card in the "Choose fresh ideas to do" section, it will be added to the slider. This way you can save the idea you are interested in in your list.

5. Allow card: When you click on a card in the slider, it will be marked as allowed. It will be removed from the slider and the information from the card will be added to the third section on the `COMPLETED` page. Allowed ideas will appear in the table as completed items.

6. Data Storage: Your assignments and accomplishments will be stored in the Database.
